## 2026-05-18 · feat(windchasers): lead modal copy-on-hover + collapsible attribution/PAT + rename Goal→Path

- `LeadDetailsModal.tsx`: added `CopyIconButton` helper component using `MdContentCopy`/`MdCheck` — renders a small (12px) copy icon that appears on row hover and copies the value to clipboard with a 1.2s "copied" check-mark confirmation
- Copy icons now appear on hover for: lead name (h2), email link, and phone link in the contact card
- Attribution panel (Source / First Touch / Last Touch) is now collapsible — click the "Attribution" header to expand/collapse; defaults to collapsed so the lead modal stays compact
- PAT Result panel is now collapsible — the score, tier badge, and chevron remain visible in the header (always-on summary), while the Qual/Apt/Rdy breakdown + 12th-eligibility detail are hidden until clicked
- Renamed "Goal:" label to "Path:" for the `course_interest` row (e.g. "Path: DGCA")
- User-facing: lead modal contact card is much shorter by default; click attribution or PAT header to drill in. Hovering over any of name/email/phone shows a small copy icon to grab the value.

## 2026-05-18 · fix(windchasers): widget welcome buttons render as chips, not full-width cards

- `ChatWidget.module.css`: removed `flex-direction: column` + `align-items: stretch` + `width: 100%` + `min-height: 52px` + `border-radius: 10px` + `text-align: left` override on `[data-brand="windchasers"] .welcomeQuickButtonsContainer/.welcomeQuickButtonRow .quickBtn` that was forcing welcome quick-buttons into a stacked full-width card layout
- Replaced with row-wrap flex container + pill chip styling: `border-radius: 9999px`, `width: auto`, `padding: 8px 14px`, `text-align: center`, `white-space: nowrap`, `min-height: 0` — chips now hug their text and wrap onto multiple lines when needed
- User-facing: WindChasers chat widget's quick-reply buttons ("I want to become a pilot", "I am a parent", "Explore Training Options") now appear as compact inline chips instead of stacked full-width buttons

## 2026-05-14 · fix(windchasers): DGCA theory papers — 5 → 6 (locked fact correction)

- `brand-facts.ts`: `dgcaSequence.detailed` updated from "5 DGCA theory papers" to "6 DGCA theory papers" with full list (Air Navigation, Aviation Meteorology, Air Regulations, Aircraft & Engines [Technical General], Aircraft Specific [Technical Specific], Radio Telephony / Communication)
- `brand-facts.ts`: `PROGRAMS.offered['dgca-ground'].shortDescription` updated to "6 DGCA papers"
- `windchasers-prompt.ts`: WhatsApp "do I need a license" canned answer updated to say "6 theory papers"
- User-facing: All three channels now match the WindChasers website's "6 critical subjects" framing. Locked fact #DGCA-papers added to running log.

## 2026-05-14 · refactor(windchasers): brand-facts single source of truth + prompt refactor (Phase 1)

- `lib/brand-facts.ts` (new): Single source of truth for all WindChasers facts — cost (up to ₹80L), timeline (18-24 months), DGCA sequence, DGCA framing distinction, faculty rules, eligibility, loan partners, international partners, programs offered/not-offered, hard rules, banned phrases, CTAs. All channels import from here.
- `configs/prompts/windchasers-prompt.ts` (WhatsApp/Aria): Replaced 329-line hardcoded prompt with a 75-line shell that imports `getBrandFactsForPrompt()`. Zero hardcoded facts. Fixes ₹40-75L → ₹80L discrepancy. Adds correct DGCA framing. Removes instructor name/salary rules that were missing or wrong.
- `configs/prompts/windchasers-web-prompt.ts` (Web/Avia): Same refactor — imports brand-facts, preserves web-specific flows (aspirant/parent paths, age routing). Channel differences: 2-4 sentences, **bold** markdown, double line breaks.
- `configs/prompts/windchasers-voice-prompt.ts` (new): Source-controlled voice prompt for Vapi. Imports brand-facts. Exports `getAviaVoicePrompt()` — copy output into Vapi dashboard. Includes spoken-number formatting (no ₹ symbols), outbound/inbound opening scripts, parent path.
- User-facing: All three channels now quote the same cost (₹80L), same timeline (18-24 months), same DGCA framing, same program list. No channel will contradict another.

## 2026-05-14 · fix(windchasers): stop AI addressing user as brand name + fix WhatsApp bold formatting

- `promptBuilder.ts`: Added `BRAND_NAMES` guard so "BCON", "windchasers", "proxe" etc. are never injected as the user's name. When WhatsApp contact name resolves to a brand slug, the `Address them by name` instruction is silently skipped.
- `agent/whatsapp/respond/route.ts`: Added post-processing sanitizer on the AI response — converts `**bold**` → `*bold*` (WhatsApp uses single asterisk for bold, not double), converts `<br>` tags to newlines, and strips any remaining HTML. Prevents raw markdown symbols from appearing in WhatsApp messages.
- User-facing: AI no longer says "BCON, great question." — and bold text now renders correctly in WhatsApp instead of showing raw asterisks.

## 2026-05-14 · fix(bcon): replace underscores with spaces in lead profile display fields

- `LeadDetailsModal.tsx`: Applied `.replace(/_/g, ' ')` to `user_type`, `course_interest`, `education`, and `timeline` display values — raw enum-style strings like `full_time` now render as `full time` in the lead details panel.
- User-facing: Lead profile cards in the BCON dashboard inbox no longer show underscored slugs.

## 2026-05-14 · fix(windchasers): preflight getUserMedia to beat Chrome's transient activation expiry

- `ChatWidget.tsx` (`handleVoiceToggle`): Added a preflight `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })` call immediately after the env-key guard, before creating the Vapi instance. Root cause: in cross-origin iframes Chrome's transient user-activation window is ~1 second; Vapi's `vapi.start()` fires a server network request before calling `getUserMedia()` internally, so the window expires before the mic dialog can appear. The preflight call happens synchronously in the click handler, firing the permission prompt while the activation is still valid. Once the user grants access the permission is stored and Vapi's own internal `getUserMedia()` succeeds.
- User-facing: Mic button on embedded `windchasers.in` pages and incognito tabs will now correctly trigger the browser's microphone permission dialog.

## 2026-05-14 · fix(windchasers): force embed.js no-cache + full mic permissions on widget iframe

- `embed.js/route.ts`: Changed `Cache-Control` from `public, max-age=3600` to `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` — previous 1-hour cache meant all visitors who loaded the page before the mic-fix deploy were still running the old iframe without `allow="microphone"`. Now every page load fetches the latest embed.js immediately.
- Added `allowusermedia=""` attribute alongside `allow="microphone; camera; autoplay; clipboard-write"` for maximum browser compatibility (covers older Chrome/Safari)
- User-facing: Vapi mic button on windchasers.in live pages now triggers mic permission dialog immediately for all visitors, not just new ones after cache expiry

## 2026-05-14 · feat(windchasers): make quick-reply buttons full-width clickable cards

- `ChatWidget.module.css`: Added windchasers brand overrides so quick-reply and flow-override buttons stack in a column and stretch to full width — the entire card area is now the click target, not just the text label
- User-facing: Buttons like "Airplane", "Helicopter", "Starting Fresh", "Yes, Completed DGCA" now render as tall full-width cards with left-aligned text, consistent with a card-tap UI pattern

## 2026-05-14 · fix(windchasers): allow microphone in embedded widget iframe

- `embed.js/route.ts`: Added `allow="microphone; camera"` attribute to the dynamically-created iframe so browsers delegate mic permission to the widget on external/live sites
- User-facing: Voice button (Avia) now triggers the microphone permission prompt on all embedded pages, not just the dashboard preview
- Root cause: dashboard preview iframe had `allow="microphone; camera"` but the embed script did not
