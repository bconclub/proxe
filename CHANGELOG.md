## 2026-05-14 · fix(windchasers): allow microphone in embedded widget iframe

- `embed.js/route.ts`: Added `allow="microphone; camera"` attribute to the dynamically-created iframe so browsers delegate mic permission to the widget on external/live sites
- User-facing: Voice button (Avia) now triggers the microphone permission prompt on all embedded pages, not just the dashboard preview
- Root cause: dashboard preview iframe had `allow="microphone; camera"` but the embed script did not
